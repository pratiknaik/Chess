GUI Testing Plan

1) Use the Standard Board class to create a standard board with squares.
2) Run the Game.java file to check if the squares on the board are correctly drawn and have no pieces on them.
3) Testing pieces on the board.
	3.1) You can call populateBoardWithPieces() in Game.java which will set up a standard chess game with all
		 the necessary pieces. Run Game.java again to check if the pieces are in the proper places originally.
	3.2) You can create any pieces that you want on the board at your specified positions and then run Game.java
		 to check if the pieces are drawn in their proper places.
